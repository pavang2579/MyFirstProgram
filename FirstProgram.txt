US Mortgage Loan default Predictions 

## Mortgage defaulter Prediction

Objective: To predict if a Mortgage borrower will default the loan.

This project is aimed at developing an analytical model to classify a mortgage borrower if he/she will be
delinquent/default on the repayments.

We have utilized the relationship of past/existing borrowers, loan characteristics to identify the significant
attributes that influence delinquency and use those to predict the probability of delinquency for future borrowers.

The outcome of this analytical approach is the probability of a borrower being delinquent given their attributes
which were identified as significant influencers during the modelling exercise.

We have used the publicly available loan borrower and performance data from FannieMae.


## Data-High level Inference

2015 Q1 data set contains 4.5 lakh borrower information

Delinquency status is stated in terms of no. of days since the last monthly payment.

We studied the characteristics of borrowers with unknown delinquency status and
borrowers who were categorized as defaulters/Regular.
